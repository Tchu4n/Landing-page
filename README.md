Landing page developed as part of the Foundations module of The Odin Project.

The goal of this project was to build a complete web page from a predefined design, using only HTML and CSS. The main focus was on practicing semantic structuring, layout organization with Flexbox, and basic styling.

The project is not responsive, following the scope proposed by the course, and served as an exercise to consolidate fundamental front-end development concepts.
